<!-- 
    In this project we used `React Async Paginate`. It's used to fetch data asynchronously. It provides an abstraction
    to handle loading more data as the user interacts with, in this case the weather API.  



*** APP component:

Function HandleOnSearchChange = (searchData) => {


}

this function is passed as props to Search component as an event to be used on handleOnChange function.
